# Number Plate Recognition System ...🚗

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Number Plate Recognition System** that utilizes **OpenCV, Keras, and TensorFlow** to detect, extract, and recognize vehicle license plates. The system first detects the number plate using **Haar Cascade Classifier**, processes the plate image, and then classifies individual characters using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **OpenCV** (for image processing and plate detection)
- **Keras & TensorFlow** (for building and training the CNN model)
- **NumPy & Pandas** (for data handling)
- **Matplotlib** (for visualization)
- **scikit-learn** (for model evaluation)

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used for training the **Number Plate Recognition System** consists of individual character images. 

- **Character Dataset**:  
   - Contains individual characters (A-Z, 0-9) extracted from number plates.  
   - Each character is stored as a grayscale image of size **28x28 pixels**.  
   - Used for training the **CNN model** to recognize letters and digits.

## 🔄 Workflow
1. **Load Image & Preprocess**
   - Read the image using OpenCV.
   - Convert it to grayscale.
   - Apply Haar Cascade to detect the number plate.
   - Crop and preprocess the detected plate.

2. **Character Segmentation**
   - Apply thresholding, erosion, and dilation to clean the image.
   - Find contours of characters.
   - Extract individual character images.

3. **Character Recognition**
   - Resize characters to 28x28.
   - Feed them into a trained CNN model.
   - Predict and decode the characters into a readable format.

4. **Model Training**
   - CNN architecture with Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dropout, and Dense layers.
   - Uses categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.
   - Trained using **ImageDataGenerator** for data augmentation.

5. **Evaluation & Performance Metrics**
   - Evaluate accuracy using a validation dataset.
   - Display confusion matrix and classification report.
